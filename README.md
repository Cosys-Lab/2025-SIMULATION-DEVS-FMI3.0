# 2025-SIMULATION-DEVS-FMI3.0

This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the results of the paper **"Adapting DEVS Semantics to FMI 3.0 Co-Simulation Using Synchronous Clocks"**.

## ðŸ“Œ Steps to Reproduce

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Cosys-Lab/2025-SIMULATION-DEVS-FMI3.0.git
    cd 2025-SIMULATION-DEVS-FMI3.0
    ```

2. **Ensure Google Protobuf is Updated**  
   *The UniFMU backends run with the system's default Python interpreter, ignoring the virtual environment (venv).  
   The Protobuf messages were compiled with version **5.27.3**, so the runtime version must be at least **5.27.3**.*
    ```sh
    pip install "protobuf>=5.27.3"
    ```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - **Windows**:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - **Linux/macOS**:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the script to reproduce results**:
    ```sh
    python run_reproduction_simulation_2025.py
    ```
